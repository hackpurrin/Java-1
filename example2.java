public class HideAndSeek { // Already explained in example 1.
  public static void main(String[] args) { // Still no clue lol.
    System.out.println("Let's play hide and seek."); // Prints out a line that says "Let's play hide and seek."
    System.out.print("Three...") // Simmilar to "println" but instead of printing a whole line, it prints all into one line. This combined with the previous line states "Let's play hide and seek. Three. Two... One..." in the console.
    System.out.print("Two...")
    System.out.print("One...")
